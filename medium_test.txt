This is a medium-sized test document for chemical equation testing.

Chemical Equations in Physics and Chemistry:

Water formation: H2 + O2 → H2O
Carbon dioxide: C + O2 → CO2
Sulfuric acid: SO3 + H2O → H2SO4
Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Ionic compounds:
Sodium chloride: Na+ + Cl- → NaCl
Calcium hydroxide: Ca2+ + 2OH- → Ca(OH)2
Ammonium sulfate: 2NH4+ + SO42- → (NH4)2SO4

Chemical reactions with arrows:
Forward: A + B → C + D
Reversible: A + B ⇌ C + D
Equilibrium: A + B ↔ C + D
